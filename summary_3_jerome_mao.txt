Summary of "Exit from Hell? Reducing the Impact of Amplification DDoS Attacks"

- Topic:

   This paper presents a comprehensive survey and study on amplification attacks. In which attacks the attackers submit requests to a remote server(s) and 
use IP spoofing (or other methods) to redirect the overwhelming responses (usually larger than the requests) to the victims. The authors perform a thorough whole 
IPv4 scanning on several known vulnerable UDP services. They analyze the results, report their efforts in help the community reduce the NTP amplification attack, 
initiate the measurement and categorizing of the TCP amplification attack (which is believed to be a possible alternative for the attackers in the future) 
and introduce their methodology in identifying the IP spoofer.

- Key Ideas/Findings

    Based on the Internet-wide scanning, they find that (a.) The highest number of amplifiers found is DNS service, (b.) some systems run multiple vulnerable 
services, (c.) Most NTP vulnerable systems run Cisco IOS; most SNMP vulnerable systems run ZyNOS; most NetBIOS systems run Windows. In addition, they investigate
the replationship between the reachability of the amplifiers and IP churn rate. They conclude: (a.) Most amplifiers will be outdated after 1-2 weeks, (b.) NTP 
amplifiers are especially insenstive to the time change/churn and (c.) the reachability of the amplifiers is affected geologically.

    Then the authors conclude that the NTP might is the most vulnerable service and thus start a campaign with some other institutes to notify the administrators 
for the systems with NTP monlist option on. Through a three monthes tracking from pre-notification to post-notification the researchers observe a tremendous drop on
the number of amplifiers through out most of the countries abd ASes. The authors believe that the providers and CERT should have a better connection in communicating the 
vulnerability notifications.

    The authors also conduct a small survey on TCP amplification. They find that nearly 50% of HTTP hosts and 55% of Telnet hosts accept an 6X or higher 
amplification; the CUPS is relatively gentle. Among the HTTP and Telnet amplifiers sending 6 packets, 20 packets and over 20 packets, most of them runs 
*nix system, the MIPS/ARM architecture based embedded system and ATM integrated, respectively.

    Finally, the authors present their remote, centralized spoofer test (which can only check whether a network allows spoofing) and the IP mismatches they observe
during the scanning; it affects the accuracy of the resolution.

- Flaws
    
    The authors spend several pages discussing the features of the amplifiers (e.g., their OS, instruction set). However, a problem that the authors fail
to talk about is whether an amplifier has ability to process such a huge number of requests and responses. Sometimes due to the limitation of hardwares (the size of input
buffer, the connection bandwidth, the IDS, etc.) the amplifiers may only forward a small number of packets, which will not make them usable in a real-world attack.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Open Question

    Based on the observation from the authors on IP churn to the number of amplifiers, can we "intentionally" churn the IPv4 namespace to reduce the potential amplifiers?
    (My answer is possibly YES) Each time we "churn" the IPv4 the attackers will need to perform a whole IPv4 scanning to find usable amplifiers. However it would be
expensive for most of the attackers. But we should also notice that intentionally "churning" IPv4 addresses is expensive for us as well.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- My Impression
    
    The author's survey on UDP amplification attack is very persuasive, especially when they are backed up with a huge dataset. In addition, their case study on reducing
NTP monlist attack demonstrates the importance the researchers should collaborate with the industry. However their spoofer test seems to be not very useful.
